# Numpy-arrays
NumPy stands for Numerical Python. It is a Python library used for working with an array. In Python, we use the list for purpose of the array but it's slow to Process. NumPy array is a powerful N-dimensional array object aand its use in linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities. It provides an array object much faster than traditional Python lists.
TYPES OF ARRAY:
1.one Dimensional Array
2.Multi-Dimensional Array
